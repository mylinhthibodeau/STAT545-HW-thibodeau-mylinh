*Each homework folder in this repository contain a README.md file, and if needed, a scratch-space, which contains manually downloaded files or early drafts, and its use allows to keep the folders more tidy.*

*I have been trying to find innovative ways to come up with genomic datasets that can fulfill the homework requirements. Please don't get distracted by the specific aspects of genomic terms, but focus on the underlying structure of the data. Genomic data is quite similar to other data types (e.g. gene names are strings, just like the countries of Gapminder). I hope you will understand that this is my 14th year of postsecondary schooling and at this point in my educational path, I am trying to focus on learning things that have direct applications to my research.*
