*Each homework folder will contain a README.md file, but not the [scratch-space](https://github.com/mylinhthibodeau/STAT545-HW-thibodeau-mylinh/tree/master/scratch-space) as it is used to store non essential images, gif or files*

*Each homework subfolder will have its own scratch-space if needed, which keeps the folders more organized*

*I have been trying to find innovative ways to come up with genomic datasets that can fulfill the homework requirements. Please don't get distracted by the specific aspects of genomic terms, but to the underlying structure of the data. Genomic data is quite similar to other data types (e.g. gene names are strings, just like the countries of Gapminder). I hope you will understand that this is my 14th year of postsecondary schooling and at this point in my educational path, I am trying to focus on learning things that have direct applications to my research.*
