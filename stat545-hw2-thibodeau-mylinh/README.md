## The curse of stubbornness 
Unfortunately, I was born with a curse called stubbornness, which leads me to look for answers relentlessly to the detriment of efficiency. 

For example, I have struggled with the folder organization of git and github repositories, and therefore, when I noted I was not able to add the reading cat gif above, I have to figure out why. Well now I understand that it is better to put my images and git into a ![separate folder](https://github.com/mylinhthibodeau/STAT545-HW-thibodeau-mylinh/tree/master/scratch-space) to keep my workspace clean, and then I can put the path of this space relative to the master origin.

# Summary of homework 2 process  
## Reading, reading, reading  

I have been reading from a lot of different resources in order to learn how to complete this homework on gapminder data exploration and use of tidyverse packages:  
- STAT545: course material covered on ![class 4](http://stat545.com/cm004_claim-repo-test-drive-rmd.html), ![class 5](http://stat545.com/cm005_tidyverse-tibbles.html) and ![class 6](http://stat545.com/cm006_tibbles-dplyr-ggplot2.html)  
- Wikipedia: [wiki page on tibble](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/tibble-data-format-in-r-best-and-modern-way-to-work-with-your-data)
- - RMarkdown [website on LaTeX options](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/pdf_document_format.html) (which I have installed, as well as Pandocs, as I thought it might reveal useful in the future).  
- [Tidyverse website](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/)  
- A lot of blogs on the use of tidyverse in data science, for example this one on the [dplyr functions (e.g. select)](https://info201-s17.github.io/book/introduction-to-the-dplyr-package.html), this one on [summarise() function](http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-genomics/04-dplyr.html), this one on [filter combined to grepl function](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22850026/filtering-row-which-contains-a-certain-string-using-dplyr) and this one on the [join functions](http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-genomics/04-dplyr.html) of dplyr.  
**You might be wondering why I have taken such an interest in reading on novel functions such as grepl and join. The reason is that I need to use R and it's functionalities to carry some genomic data analyses in the short term period.**
