### Genomic dataset - A few clarifications

Vincenzo Coia has approved my request to use published genomic data for the homework assignments.

* I have tried to introduce some basic explanations about the genomic dataset, but obviously, this is not a genetics course and my objective is to explore and learn how to use R and its packages, not to teach complex notions of cancer genomic analysis. Therefore, I don't expect people to understand what the data and plots represent if they haven't studied in related fields. 
* I would recommend you make abstraction of the underlying biological context and simply try to read this homework based on the variable types (e.g. copy.category is a categorical variable like "gain" or "loss") rather than what they represent.

*SOURCE OF DATA - supplementary files of published article*

# Summary of homework 4 process  

I annotated quite extensively my homework 3, and it reads fairly like a narrative. Therefore, I will not repeat the same information here and will provide a brief overview of my learning process instead.
