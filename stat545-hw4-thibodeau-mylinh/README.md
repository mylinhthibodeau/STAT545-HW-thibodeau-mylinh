### Genomic dataset - A few clarifications

Vincenzo Coia has approved my request to use published genomic data for the homework assignments.

* I have tried to introduce some basic explanations about the genomic dataset, but obviously, this is not a genetics course and my objective is to explore and learn how to use R and its packages, not to teach complex notions of cancer genomic analysis. Therefore, I don't expect people to understand what the data and plots represent if they haven't studied in related fields. 
* I would recommend you make abstraction of the underlying biological context and simply try to read this homework based on the variable types (e.g. copy.category is a categorical variable like "gain" or "loss") rather than what they represent.

# Valuable lesson learned

After trying for 3h to complete the homework 4 exercises with the data I used in [homework 3](https://github.com/mylinhthibodeau/STAT545-HW-thibodeau-mylinh/tree/master/stat545-hw3-thibodeau-mylinh), that regardless of how I organized the data, I still didn't have the right data format to complete the exercises.

I was trying to do the homework with an "unfit" dataset:

*I have learned to think about the underlying structure of a dataset before trying to do anything with it ! I am hoping I won't make the same mistake again in the future and that I will be able to recognize these situations promptly rather than try to solve unsolvable problems due to the nature of the dataset.*

# Summary of homework 4 process  

I annotated quite extensively my homework 4, and it reads fairly like a narrative. Therefore, I will not repeat the same information here and will provide a brief overview of my learning process instead.
