# Genomic datasets - A few clarifications

Vincenzo Coia has approved my request to use published genomic data for the next assignments, therefore, I want to provide a few clarifications:

* I have tried to introduce some basic explanations about the genomic dataset, but as my objective is to explore and learn how to use R and its packages, not to teach cancer genomic analysis, I am sorry in advance if you are not sure what the data and plots represent, but focus on the data manipulation behind and not what the data represents, and I hope you will still enjoy reading my homework !
* If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to let me know :) 
* Given the size of the data, I only display a few rows per table to keep it readable.

## SOURCES OF DATA: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and ClinVar

# Get the data and clean the data

```{r}
chek2_rna_cnv <- read.table("/Users/mylinh/Desktop/chek2-data-trial-stat545/chek2-rna-expression-cnv-data.txt", sep="\t",  strip.white = TRUE, header = TRUE)
View(chek2_rna_cnv) 
# class(chek2_rna_cnv)
# typeof(chek2_rna_cnv)
summary(chek2_rna_cnv) %>% kable("html") %>% kable_styling()
dim(chek2_rna_cnv)
```
**Note 1.** I tried to use the functions from readr (read_table(), read_table2 and read_tsv()), but the column names with spaces (e.g. Ensembl gene ID) were not converted to column names with dot separation like it is done in read.table (E.g. Ensembl gene ID -> Ensembl.gene.ID.), which messed up the full data frame. I had error messages when trying to use dget() and dput. Therefore, why change a functional approach: I decided to keep read.table to do this homework.

Let's clean up the data first:

* Remove the rows for which there is no empty values for these columns: chr, start, end, strand, Ensembl.gene.ID., hugo
* fill the cancer.gene.type empty cells with the mention "NA" 
* remove the duplicate hugo genes

```{r}
chek2_rna_cnv <- with(chek2_rna_cnv, chek2_rna_cnv[!(chr==""),])
chek2_rna_cnv <- with(chek2_rna_cnv, chek2_rna_cnv[!(start==""),])
chek2_rna_cnv <- with(chek2_rna_cnv, chek2_rna_cnv[!(end==""),])
chek2_rna_cnv <- with(chek2_rna_cnv, chek2_rna_cnv[!(Ensembl.gene.ID==""),])
chek2_rna_cnv <- with(chek2_rna_cnv, chek2_rna_cnv[!(hugo==""),])
chek2_rna_cnv$cancer.gene.type <- as.character(chek2_rna_cnv$cancer.gene.type)
chek2_rna_cnv$cancer.gene.type[chek2_rna_cnv$cancer.gene.type==""] <- "NA"
chek2_rna_cnv$cancer.gene.type <- as.factor(chek2_rna_cnv$cancer.gene.type)
gene_types <- levels(chek2_rna_cnv$cancer.gene.type)
chek2_rna_cnv <- chek2_rna_cnv %>%
  group_by(hugo) %>%
  slice(1L)
dim(chek2_rna_cnv)
```
** Note 1.** You might have noticed that I manipulated the cancer.gene.type variable to change it to a character in order to replace the cancer.gene.type empty cells by "NA", then converted back to a factor, which partially answers exercise **(1A)** (see below)

# HOMEWORK REQUIREMENTS

Goals:

1. Reorder a factor in a principled way based on the data and demonstrate the effect in arranged data and in figures.
2. Improve a figure (or make one from scratch), using new knowledge, e.g., control the color scheme, use factor levels, smoother mechanics.
3. Implement visualization design principles.
4. Write some data to file and load it back into R. E.g., save a plot to file and include it in a R Markdown report via ![Alt text](/path/to/img.png).
5. Organise your github, to celebrate the completion of STAT 545 and/or to prepare for the glorious future of STAT 547.

# (1) Reorder a factor in a principled way

**Note 1.** I searched several online dictionaries, and I still do not understand the meaning of "principled": the online dictionaries are giving me answers like ["based on moral rules"](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/principled) and ["(of a system or method) based on a given set of rules"](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/principled), so I will conclude that if my approach is coherent and follow a logical path, it is principled.   

## (1A) Factorise

Transform some of the variable of chek2_rna_cnv into factors. In cleaning up the dataset, we converted a factors column into characters then back to factors. 

Let's see what class of data we have in chek2_rna_cnv first. 
```{r}
sapply(chek2_rna_cnv, class) %>% kable("html") %>% kable_styling()
```

Change the avg.TCGA.percentile (class integer) to factors with base R:
```{r}
chek2_rna_cnv$avg.TCGA.percentile <- as.factor(chek2_rna_cnv$avg.TCGA.percentile)
chek2_rna_cnv %>% 
  select(hugo,avg.TCGA.percentile) %>%
  head(10) %>% kable("html") %>% kable_styling()
chek2_rna_cnv$avg.TCGA.percentile %>% head(10) %>% kable("html") %>% kable_styling()
nlevels(chek2_rna_cnv$avg.TCGA.percentile)
#avg.TCGA.percentile_types <- levels(chek2_rna_cnv$avg.TCGA.percentile) # alternative method to count levels
#avg.TCGA.percentile_types
#length(avg.TCGA.percentile_types)
#avg.TCGA.percentile_types
```

Change the avg.TCGA.percentile (class integer) to factors with forcats:

```{r}
chek2_rna_cnv$avg.TCGA.percentile <- as_factor(chek2_rna_cnv$avg.TCGA.percentile) 
chek2_rna_cnv %>% 
  select(hugo,avg.TCGA.percentile) %>%
  head(10) %>% kable("html") %>% kable_styling()
chek2_rna_cnv$avg.TCGA.percentile %>% head(10) %>% kable("html") %>% kable_styling()
#avg.TCGA.percentile_types <- levels(chek2_rna_cnv$avg.TCGA.percentile)
#avg.TCGA.percentile_types
```

In my case, I obtain the same result with base R and forcats with the avg.TCGA.percentile as factors, although I know that base R has a tendency to try re-ordering the data, which is not alway what we want, but the code syntax I used did not lead to this problem for me. 

## (1B) Drop 0

Filter chek2_rna_cnv to remove all the avg.TCGA.percentile equal to 0 and drop unused levels.

```{r}
nlevels(chek2_rna_cnv$avg.TCGA.percentile)
# Method 1 - gdata
d1 <- chek2_rna_cnv %>%
  filter(avg.TCGA.percentile != 0) %>%
  arrange(avg.TCGA.percentile) %>%
  select(hugo, avg.TCGA.percentile)
nlevels(d1$avg.TCGA.percentile)
d1 <- data.frame(d1)
d1 <- drop.levels(d1)
#length(levels(d1$avg.TCGA.percentile)) # alternative method to count levels
nlevels(d1$avg.TCGA.percentile)

# Method 2 - Base R
nlevels(chek2_rna_cnv$avg.TCGA.percentile)
d1_v2 <- chek2_rna_cnv %>%
  filter(avg.TCGA.percentile != 0) %>%
  arrange(avg.TCGA.percentile) %>%
  select(hugo, avg.TCGA.percentile)
class(d1_v2)
d1_v2 <- ungroup(d1_v2)
class(d1_v2)
nlevels(d1_v2$avg.TCGA.percentile)
d1_v2 <- d1_v2 %>%
  droplevels()
nlevels(d1_v2$avg.TCGA.percentile)

# Method 3 - forcats
d1_v3 <- chek2_rna_cnv %>%
  filter(avg.TCGA.percentile != 0) %>%
  arrange(avg.TCGA.percentile) %>%
  select(hugo, avg.TCGA.percentile)
nlevels(d1_v3$avg.TCGA.percentile)
d1_v3 <- ungroup(d1_v3)
d1_v3$avg.TCGA.percentile %>%
  fct_drop() %>%
  nlevels()
```
**Note 1.** In the example above, you can see that the number of levels is initially 101 (length function) and after removing the avg.TCGA.percentile equal to 0, the number of levels is 100, so I successfully dropped the unused level "0".

**Note 2.** To do this, I used a function of the gdata package, as exemplified  [here](https://www.r-bloggers.com/r-drop-factor-levels-in-a-dataset/)

**Note 3.** I had trouble with further manipulations on the data.frame because its class was grouped ("grouped_df" "tbl_df" "tbl" "data.frame") so I had to use the ungroup() function as shown [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26694484/in-r-how-do-you-select-for-a-data-frame-that-has-been-grouped). 


## (1C) Reorder the levels of avg.TCGA.percentile, cancer.gene.type or copy.category

Use the forcats package to change the order of the factor levels, based on a principled summary of one of the quantitative variables. Consider experimenting with a summary statistic beyond the most basic choice of the median.

### BASE R

#### INITIAL PLOT

I will plot the RPKM value according to each hugo gene.

```{r}
d2 <- chek2_rna_cnv %>%
  filter(avg.TCGA.percentile != 0) %>%
  arrange(avg.TCGA.percentile)
d2 <- ungroup(d2)
p1 <- d2 %>%
  group_by(hugo) %>%
  arrange(RPKM) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=hugo, y=RPKM))
p1 + geom_point(aes(colour=cancer.gene.type), alpha = 0.6) + 
  theme(text = element_text(size=12), axis.title.x=element_blank(), axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x=element_blank())
```
**Note 1.** This is not very pretty, I would like to re-order the hugo gene according to their increasing value of RPKM.

**Note 2.** Using the arrange() function did not resolve this problem because the factors "hugo" are not re-arranged according to RPKM. We need additional functions to do so (see below for examples).

#### PLOT AFTER ARRANGING FACTOR HUGO ACCORDING TO RPKM VALUE  

I will arrange the order of the factor hugo according to the ascending value of RPKM, as previously exemplified in my [homework 3](https://github.com/mylinhthibodeau/STAT545-HW-thibodeau-mylinh/tree/master/stat545-hw3-thibodeau-mylinh).

```{r}
d2$hugo <- factor(d2$hugo, levels = d2$hugo[order(d2$RPKM)]) 
p1 <- d2 %>%
  group_by(hugo) %>%
  arrange(RPKM) %>%
  filter(cancer.gene.type != "NA") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=hugo, y=RPKM))
p1 + geom_point(aes(colour=cancer.gene.type), alpha = 0.6) + 
  theme(text = element_text(size=12), axis.title.x=element_blank(), axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x=element_blank())
```

### FORCATS


#### REORDER ACCORDING TO MEAN PERCENTILE


I will start by changing the lcass of avg.TCGA.percentile back to a numeric so that I can do a mean function on it. Then, I will show the difference between ordered and un-ordered factors cancer.gene.type according to the mean.
```{r}
chek2_rna_cnv$avg.TCGA.percentile <- as.numeric(chek2_rna_cnv$avg.TCGA.percentile)
chek2_rna_cnv <- ungroup(chek2_rna_cnv)
d3 <- chek2_rna_cnv %>%
  filter(avg.TCGA.percentile != 0) %>%
  arrange(avg.TCGA.percentile) %>%
  group_by(cancer.gene.type)
d3.mean.percentile.by.type <- d3 %>%
  group_by(cancer.gene.type) %>%
  summarize(mean.percentile.by.type = mean(avg.TCGA.percentile, na.rm =TRUE))
d3.mean.percentile.by.type  %>% kable("html") %>% kable_styling()
# cancer.gene.type factors in alphabetical order
p3 <- d3.mean.percentile.by.type %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=cancer.gene.type, y = mean.percentile.by.type))
p3 + geom_point() + theme(text = element_text(size=12), axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, hjust=1))
# cancer.gene.type factors ordered according to the mean.percentile.by.type      
p3 <- d3.mean.percentile.by.type %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=fct_reorder(cancer.gene.type, mean.percentile.by.type), y = mean.percentile.by.type))
p3 + geom_point() + theme(text = element_text(size=12), axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, hjust=1))
```


#### REORDER ACCORDING TO FREQUENCY

We can also order the data.frame factors according to their frequency. 

```{r}
class(d2$avg.TCGA.percentile)
levels(d2$avg.TCGA.percentile)
d2$avg.TCGA.percentile %>%
  fct_infreq() %>%
  levels() %>% head()
```
**Note 1.** So the most frequent factor is 49, followed by 2 and 1, etc.


PLOT EXAMPLE

We will plot the avg.TCGA.percentile factors in un-ordered way, then ordered by frequency. We will only use the 2000 first data entries. 
```{r}
p4 <- d2 %>%
  group_by(cancer.gene.type) %>%
  head(2000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=avg.TCGA.percentile))
p4 + geom_bar(aes(fill=cancer.gene.type))
p4 <- d2 %>%
  group_by(cancer.gene.type) %>%
  head(2000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=fct_infreq(avg.TCGA.percentile)))
p4 + geom_bar(aes(fill=cancer.gene.type))
```

**Note 1.** The reason why the factors are not the same than illustrated in the previous example is because I only selected the first 2000 data entries and the factors were already ordered in ascending fashion in the d2 dataset.

## (1D) Characterize the (derived) data before and after your factor re-leveling.

* Explore the effects of arrange(). Does merely arranging the data have any effect on, say, a figure?

Answer: As exemplified above, arrange() is not sufficient to re-order data according to a factor. For example, the hugo genes were not re-ordered according to the RPKM even after using arrange(RPKM), and the visual output is not very intuitine. We need to use functions of base R or forcats to do this (see examples above).

* Explore the effects of reordering a factor and factor reordering coupled with arrange(). Especially, what effect does this have on a figure?

Answer: As mentioned previously, factors have to be treated a different way. When we are ploting numerical values according to numerical values, we can use arrange to re-order the data, but when we use factors, it requires extra-steps in order to go around "R who is trying to re-order your factors data for you (without your permission)".

* These explorations should involve the data, the factor levels, and some figures.

Answer: Please refer above for several tables, ways of counting and dropping levels and plots.
