# About me

Dear reader,

I hope you will enjoy reading my STAT545/547 homework :) I am a Medical Genetics resident and master student in bioinformatics and my topic of research is cancer genomics. 

I have been trying to find innovative ways to come up with genomic datasets that can fulfill the homework requirements. Please don't get distracted by the specific aspects of genomic terms, but focus on the underlying structure of the data. Genomic data is quite similar to other data types (e.g. gene names are strings, just like the countries of Gapminder).


Thank you for your time!
Regards,
My Linh Thibodeau

# Source of data

For this homework, I will be using open access complete set of cancer somatic mutations from: 

Alexandrov, L. B. et al. Signatures of mutational processes in human cancer. 500, 415â€“421 (2013).


# HOMEWORK FILES TO REVIEW

* Homework 7 RMD file 
* Homework 7 MD file 

I have a scratch-space in each subfolder of my repository, which contains manually saved data files or intermediate files to do my homework. It keeps my repository folders more tidy.
